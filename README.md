# Pac-Man Clone
A clone of the popular Pac-Man game, implemented in C++ using the Qt library. The game replicates the original Pac-Man's ghost algorithms, with each ghost featuring its distinctive behavior pattern to chase Pac-Man.

## Features

- **Authentic Ghost Algorithms:** Each ghost in the game uses a unique algorithm based on the original Pac-Man game, providing a challenging experience.
- **Built with Qt:** Utilizes the powerful Qt framework for graphical user interface and game logic.
